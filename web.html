    <p>Leo (also marketed as Leo: Bloody Sweet) is an upcoming Indian Tamil-language action film[2] directed by Lokesh
        Kanagaraj, who co-wrote the script with Rathna Kumar and Deeraj Vaidy. It is produced by Seven Screen Studio.
        The film stars Vijay and Trisha, alongside Sanjay Dutt, Arjun Sarja, Gautham Vasudev Menon, Mansoor Ali Khan,
        and Mysskin. The film was officially announced in January 2023 under the tentative title Thalapathy 67, as it is
        Vijay's 67th film as a lead actor, and the title of the film was announced a few days later. Principal
        photography commenced the same month in Chennai along with a sporadic schedule in Kashmir. It is scheduled to
        conclude in mid-July. The film has music composed by Anirudh Ravichander, cinematography handled by Manoj
        Paramahamsa and editing by Philomin Raj. Leo is scheduled to be released in theatres worldwide on 19 October
        2023.</p>

        <p>Vijay would sport a grey-shaded hairstyle for his character, which was finalised after 30 different
            looks.[39][40] Trisha was cast as the female lead,[41] pairing opposite Vijay for the fifth time after
            Ghilli (2004), Thirupaachi (2005), Aathi (2006) and Kuruvi (2008).[42][43] Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt was
            confirmed to play one of the main antagonists, in his Tamil film debut as well as his second South Indian
            film after K.G.F: Chapter 2 (2022).[44] Dutt agreed to be a part of the project, after being impressed by
            the one-line narrated for the film.[45] Priya Anand also joined the film in an important role,[46] whilst
            Arjun was also cast in an important role.[47] He called it a "different" and "fresh" one that would justify
            his title "action king".[48] Mysskin,[49] Sandy Master,[50] Gautham Vasudev Menon,[51] and Mansoor Ali Khan
            would play prominent roles.[52] Malayalam actor Mathew Thomas, would also make his Tamil debut with the

            and Janany Kunaseelan were present at the film's preliminary shooting, confirming their presence in the
            film;[55][56] the latter would make her acting debut in a feature with this film.[55] George Maryan was also
            featured in the muhurat puja, thereby confirming his inclusion.[57] Abhirami Venkatachalam and Babu Antony
            were also confirmed after participating in the film's Kashmir schedule.[58][59] Manobala died on 3 May 2023,
            making Leo a posthumous release for him.[60]</p>
